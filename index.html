            </div>
            <p>Contemporary climate change includes both global warming caused by humans and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are more rapid than any known events in Earth's
                history.[2] The main cause is the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steel making, cement production, and forest loss
                are additional sources.[3] Temperature rise is also affected by climate feedbacks such as the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, and the release of carbon dioxide from drought-stricken forests. Collectively, these amplify global warming</p>

        <p>The Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) is a scoring system designed by the German environmental and development organisation Germanwatch e.V. to enhance transparency in international climate politics. On the basis of standardised criteria,
            the index evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 57 countries and the European Union (EU) (status 2020), which are together responsible for more than 90% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Climate Change Performance
            Index was first published in 2005 and an updated version is presented at the UN Climate Change Conference annually. Germanwatch publishes the index in cooperation with the NewClimate Institute and Climate Action Network International and with
            financial support from Barthel Foundation.[1] The most important results are available in German, English, French and Spanish.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere,
                increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.</p>
